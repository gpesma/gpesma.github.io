Worked as developer for LEGO Mindstorms under the supervision of Chris Rogers<br>
Designed and implemented a LabView program that taught children basic robotics with no prior<br>
programming exposure. The state machine system automated pre-programmed behavior based on<br>
input combinations of sensors and motors from the user.<br><br>

Conceived and prototyped a next generation Mindstorms kit that distributed intelligence to a<br>
network of components. Built a library of functions for a distributed intelligence robotics kit that<br>
used TCP/IP.<br><br>
