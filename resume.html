&nbsp&nbsp<div class="italics"> Boston, MA</div><br>

Worked as developer for LEGO Mindstorms under the supervision of Chris Rogers.<br>
Designed and implemented a LabView program that taught children basic robotics with no prior
programming exposure. The state machine system automated pre-programmed behavior based on
input combinations of sensors and motors from the user.<br><br>

Conceived and prototyped a next generation Mindstorms kit that distributed intelligence to a
network of components. Built a library of functions for a distributed intelligence robotics kit that
used TCP/IP.<br><br>
